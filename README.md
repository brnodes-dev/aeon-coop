## 🌟 What You Can Do

- **Save in Groups**: Create *Coops* (collaborative savings circles) to pool funds with friends.
- **Friends List**: Save your friends’ wallet addresses for quick access when creating new Coops.
- **Savings Incentive**: Anyone withdrawing early pays a small fee that rewards those who stay until the end.
- **Full Transparency**: Track deposits, see how much each friend has contributed, and monitor progress toward the goal.
